# Applying NLP to the Analysis of SenseMaker Narratives


As part of the analysis process, it is very common for SenseMaker practitioners to look at self-signification (patterns, sometimes statistics), but to leave narratives unused. 

This tactic has been mainly driven by two factors:

1. The notion that the meaning of words is relative and situational. This is true. But what is also true is that words are essential tools individuals use to communicate and dismissing them can lead to omitting important details and themes;

2. The difficulty of automating analysis of unstructured and uncleaned text. 

Documents on this page summarise our work on applying natural language processing (NLP) technique to SenseMaker narrative data. This work was also presented at the webinar (video here):

-	[Notebook.pdf](Notebook.pdf)  - version of the notebook containing methodological underpinning, links to readings, outputs, and R script;
-	[Notebook.Rmd](Notebook.Rmd) - file containing underlying R script in R Markdown format;
-	[Slides for the webinar](webinar_nlp.pdf).
